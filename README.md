# Guessing-Tree
Similar to twenty questions, this tree will traverse itself as you answer yes or no questions.  As it guesses wrong, it will ask you to provide the correct answer and add this distinction to it's tree, essentially learning as you play. 

Run it using command line prompts 'make' then './questions'.
